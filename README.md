This was proposed by The Odin Project. 
Learned things: Web local storage, data-attributes (for dynamic index). How to use webpack, and npm. Also practiced the use of "classes", and ES6 modules,
but didn't find the need to implement on such a small app. 
Maybe I'll come another time and make more functionalities
